# Daily Coding problems - my codes
Everyday, Daily Coding Problems proposes a quick interview question from big companies interviews. 

Instead of doing sudokus or a chess game on my way back from the office, I stock here my coding propositions. 
The problems are never long or difficult, but there is always a good idea behind...!

Kudos Daily Coding Problems!
